The [SBL Hebrew Font User
Manual](https://www.sbl-site.org/Fonts/SBLHebrewUserManual1.5x.pdf) is worth a
skim. There is a lot that goes into a unicode Hebrew font whent the cantilation
and other Hebrew Bible marks come into play. 

One issue is normalization. You should not normalize Hebrew fonts because it may
affect the ordering of vowels and cantilation marks.

Psalm 27:13 is an example of a problematic Hebrew verse with extra markings that
are in the text but unknown: 

<div class=hebrew>לׅׄוּלֵׅ֗ׄאׅׄ הֶ֭אֱמַנְתִּי לִרְא֥וֹת בְּֽטוּב־יְהוָ֗ה בְּאֶ֣רֶץ חַיִּֽים׃</div>
