## The Semantic Root

- Semitic languages are built on a consonantal root pattern.
- Generally there are three consonants that form the basis for many derivatives.
    - Each consonant is called a radical.
    - The sequence of radicals is called the root.
- Derivatives are formed with vowel patterns, prefixes, suffixes, and duplication.
- **p-r-s** is the traditional paradigmatic root.
    - sometimes R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>R<sub>3</sub> and V are used instead.

## Verbs

### Verb Semantics

- Active-transitive: 
    - take a direct object
- Active-intransitive:
    - do not take a direct object
    - often verbs of motion
- Stative (adjectival):
    - to be X or to become X

Note: some verbs can be in more than one category.

### Verb Stems

- Semitic verbs appear in **stems**.
    - Stems affect the formation and meaning of the verb.
    - Equivalent to *binyanim* in modern Hebrew designations.
    - Learning the G-stem, also called *Grundstamm*.
        - It is the "basic" stem.
        - Equivalent to the Hebrew Qal stem.

### G Infinitive

- The infinitive is a **declinable noun**, meaning that it has noun endings.
    - Plural forms of the infinitive do not exist.
- It follows the *parās* + noun ending pattern. (*šakānum*, *šakānim*) (R<sub>1</sub>aR<sub>2</sub>āR<sub>3</sub>-noun ending)
- Infinitives following prepositions often have special meanings that must be memorized.
- All verbs are listed under the infinitive in modern Akkadian dictionaries.
- Infinitive is often best translated with a gerund.
wardum ina *šakānim* ša ḫurāṣim imqut
The slave fell when stealing the gold.
- Infinitive following a preposition may have a special meaning:
    - *ana* + infin = in order to
    - *ina* + infin = when, while, by


### G Preterite

#### Form

- The base is R<sub>1</sub>R<sub>2</sub>VR<sub>3</sub>.
    - The V is **theme vowel**.
    - The theme vowel is always short in the G preterite.
    - The theme vowel is unpredictable and must be memorized per root.
        - *iškun* > *šakānum*, *išriq* > *šarāqum*, iṣbat > ṣabātum
- Prefixes and suffixes are added to decline the verb.

#### Meaning

- Preterite is punctual (viewed as having occurred at single point in time) 
- Best translated as single past tense.
- The pronominal subject (I, you, etc.) is implicit in the verb.
- Independent pronouns are added for:
    - emphasis
    - enumerating the subject (you and I (we) went...)
    - Independent pronouns stand at the beginning of verbal clauses (contra verbless clauses).

## Word Order

- Normal word order is Subject — Direct Object — Adjunct — Verb.
- Adjuncts are all adverbs, prepositional phrases, indirect objects, etc.
- Can be rearranged.
- Verb is ALWAYS last.
- Verbs must agree with their subjects in person, gender, and number.
    - Dual subjects are usually treated as feminine plural even when they are masculine.
    - Compound subjects take plural verbs.
        - If any member is masculine, the verb is masculine.
    - Collective nouns can take singular or plural verbs.
