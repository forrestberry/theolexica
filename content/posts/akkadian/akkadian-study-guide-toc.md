## What

These are all of my study guides for John Huehnergard's *[A Grammar of Akkadian](https://www.academia.edu/234697/2013_Key_to_A_Grammar_of_Akkadian_3rd_edition_)* Third Edition.

I am making these as I learn. I am not an expert. Use at your own risk.

## Goal

Outline the bare-bones of the grammar in an easily digestible and memorizable format.

Include an flashcard deck for each section. I use [anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) and I [recommend that you do too]({{ relref "anki.md" }}). The flash cards are in csv format.

Non-goal: to be a cliff-notes or drop in replacement for the grammar. (Much of this information will be incomprehensible without the grammar.)
