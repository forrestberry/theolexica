Technically the feminine endings are *—um*, *—im*, but the āt infix (see below) is perfectly regular.

### Case
- nominative: subjects, nominal predicates
- genitive: possession, noun-noun modification, after prepositions
- accusative: direct object, adverbial expressions
- oblique: the combined genitive/accusative case is sometimes referred to as oblique

### Gender
- There are two genders: masculine and feminine.
- Feminine is generally marked out by a *t* infix. 
    - For phonological reasons, the *t* can be preceeded by an *a* when the base ends in two consonants. (See syllable rules in chapter 1.)
    - e.g. il*t*um, šarr*at*um
- Exceptions:
    - Some nouns that look masculine are feminine and vice versa.
    - Some nouns that are masculine in the singular are feminine in the plural.
        - But all singular feminine nouns are feminine in the plural.
    - Some nouns are variable gender.
    - Masculine is the common plural.
    - Exceptions need to be memorized.

### Number
- There are three numbers: singular, dual, plural.
- Singular
    - End in *m* (mimation)
- Dual
    - The dual indicates precisely two and is usully confined to natural pairs (eg, eyes)
    - Genitive and accusative have the same form
    - end in *n* (nunation)
    - Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns do not have dual forms (in OB).
    - Dual nouns have **feminine** plural agreement with adjectives and verbs (rarely take masculine plural).
- Plural
    - Genitive and accusative have the same form.
    - In the masculine, the ending is a macron-long version of the singular vowel ending. (um > ū, im > ī)
    - In the feminine, the *t* infix is always accompanied with a *ā* (-āt-)
    - In the feminine, end in *m* (mimation)
    - Some words occur only in plural.
    - "Collectives" are collective nouns that describe groups and can be construed in singular or plural (e.g. ṣābum: singular= worker, solder; collective= gang, troop)

### Miscellaneous
- There is no definite or indefinite marker. Context determines.
- Final -m is called mimation
- Final -n is called nunation


## Prepositions

- Most prepositions are two-syllable words ending in a short vowel.
- Nouns following prepositions are always in the genitive.

## ša

- ša means "the one of"
- usually occurs in apposition to a preceeding noun
- the following noun appears in the genitive
- eg šarrum ša Bābilim (king of Babylon)

- Used in subjects of verbless clauses (see more uses in Chapter 3)

## Verbless Clauses

- No being verb in Akkadian.
- Copulative sentences are formed by juxtaposing the subject and predicate. 
- Called verbless or nominative clauses
- If subject is a noun, it stands at beginning of the clause.
- If subject is a pronoun, it stands at the end of the clause.
- Tense is determined by context.

*amātum ina ālim* "The maidservants are/were/will be in the town."

- Adverb (phrase) - Noun (phrase) occurs less frequently.

*ina libbim ša ālim nārum* "In the center of the town (there) is a river."

- With ša and a following genitive, verbless clauses represent simple possession.

*bītum ša iltim* "The house is the goddess's."
