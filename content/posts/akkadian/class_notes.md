## Introduction

Reasons to study Akkadian:
- For the Biblical scholar:
    1. Better understand the culture in which the Bible was written.
    2. Helps us understand Hebrew as a language
- Worthy in its own right
    - massive amount of texts and cultural understanding

Comparative Studies:
- See Yale's course on [Intro to the Hebrew Bible](https://oyc.yale.edu/religious-studies/rlst-145) by Christine Hayes

## Language Familes
- Can start to relate languages using the [Swadesh List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swadesh_list)
- Historical Linguistics: track a language through texts in history.
- About 7500 languages in the world
    - can be divided into 180 language families
    - ~50 isolate languages
    - Indo-European language - most of the languages from Europe to India are related
    - Afro-Asiatic languages - Semitic part of this group

### Semitic Language Families
- East
    - Akkadian and Eblaite
- West
    - majority of the (known) Semitic Languages
    - Arabic, Hebrew, Aramaic, etc. 
- Divided East and West based on grammar (not geography)
    - big division is grammatical, not geographical
    - division is caused by geography 
    - e.g. In Hebrew, I wrote qtvti. In Akkadian, the similar form (qatalku) is not perfective. It is predicative (see Lesson 22).

## Chapter 1

u marks the nominative case
mimation: m is attached to short vowels in nouns in semitic languages
nunation: n is attached at the end of some nouns in semitic languages
qaqqadum - the q is doubled because a d assimilates
