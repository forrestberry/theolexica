## Introduction

- Akkadian is 
    - the oldest Semitic language.
    - the lingua franca of the ANE from about 2000-500 BC
    - aka Assyrian and Babylonian
- Material culture
    - written on clay tablets (good because virtually indestructible)
        - vary in size from 1in square to 18in square
        - most are hand-sized rectangles
        - written on the face, but also the edges (often so could be read on a shelf)
    - written with wedge-shaped stylus
    - hundreds of thousands of extant texts (more than classical Latin)
- Cuneiform
    - "wedge shaped"
    - writing system of Akkadian
    - syllable based
    - adapted from Sumerian (a non-related but geographically close language)
    - each character called a "sign"
    - thousands of signs
        - varies based on time and geography
        - transliteration involves use of *sign list*

### Dialects
- **Assyrian** (in the north)
- **Babylonian** (in the south)
- **Old Babylonian** becomes the classical standard
- **Standard Babylonian** is the later imitation of Old Babylonian
- **Peripheral Akkadian** is the term for the Akkadian dialects of futher reaches (often mixed with the grammar and vocabulary of the native language.)
