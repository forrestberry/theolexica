## Alephs and Vowel Changes

- There were five Proto-Semitic letters that are not present in Akkadian. These are referred to as aleph 1-5. (Some of these alephs exist in Hebrew.)
    - ʾ<sub>1</sub> = ʾ (א)
    - ʾ<sub>2</sub> = h (ה)
    - ʾ<sub>3</sub> = ḥ (ח)
    - ʾ<sub>4</sub> = ʿ (ע)
    - ʾ<sub>5</sub> = ǵ (ע)
- The Akkadian letters *y* and *w* may also be referred to as alephs.
    - ʾ<sub>6</sub> = w (ו)
    - ʾ<sub>7</sub> = y (י)
- These alephs largely disappear in Akkadian, but they can affect the word formation.
    - If a word began or ended with an ʾ<sub>1-7</sub>, the aleph was lost with no change to the word.

        \*ʾabum > abum (father)

        (exception for *w*, eg wardum)

    - If a word lost an ʾ<sub>1-7</sub> next to a vowel, the vowel lengthend with a macron.

        \*nahrum > nārum (river)

    - If a word lost an ʾ<sub>1-7</sub> between vowels, the two vowels went thru changes based on what they were:
        - *e* or *i* followed by *a* = no change (if first vowel is long, it will become short)
        - *ā* or *ē* followed by *i* = *ê*
        - XY = Ŷ
    - ʾ<sub>3-4</sub> caused *a* to turn to *e*. This can show up when comparing Hebrew and Akkadian.

        \*baʿlum > \*beʿlum > bēlum (בַּ֫עַל)

## Demonstrative Adjectives and Pronouns

### *Annum* (This/these)

**Note**: This paradigm demonstrates the effect of the aleph and vowel changes above. *annum* in Proto-Semitic was *\*hanniy-*. The *h* is dropped without any affect. However, when the y is dropped and the endings are added, changes occur.

<table>
    <caption>Annum</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Masculine</th>
          <th>Feminine</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Nom S</td>
            <td>annûm (*hanniyium)</td>
            <td>annītum (*hanniytum)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Gen S</td>
            <td>annîm (*hanniyim)</td>
            <td>annītim (*hanniytim)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Acc S</td>
            <td>anniam (*hanniyam)</td>
            <td>annītam (*hanniytam)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Nom P</td>
            <td>annûtum (*hanniyūtum)</td>
            <td>anniātum (*hanniyātum)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Gen/Acc P</td>
            <td>annûtim (*hanniyūtim)</td>
            <td>anniātim (*hanniyātim)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

- *annum* is the most common near demonstrative in OB.
- When paired with other adjectives, it comes last (eg. *šamnum ṭābum annum* this fine oil)
- The feminine singular (*annītum*) may be used as a neuter demonstrative pronoun.

### *Šū* (That/those)

**Note**: The far demonstrative is the 3rd person independent pronouns ([Lesson 2]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-002.md" >}})).

<table>
    <caption>šū</caption>
    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>Masculine</th>
          <th>Feminine</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
            <th>Nom S</td>
            <td>šū</td>
            <td>šī</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Gen/Acc S</td>
            <td>šuāti (šuātu, šâti, šâtu)</td>
            <td>šuāti (šâti, šiāti)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Dat S</td>
            <td>šuāšim (šâšim, šâšum)</td>
            <td>šuāšim (šâšim, šiāšim)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Nom P</td>
            <td>šunu</td>
            <td>šina</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Gen/Acc P</td>
            <td>šunuti</td>
            <td>šināti</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Dat P</td>
            <td>šunūšim</td>
            <td>--</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>

- The forms in parentheses are dialectictical variations.
- The dative case only occurs after *ana*.
- This is **anaphoric** meaning it always refers back to something already known.
    - Often translate as "the aforementioned", "said", "this/these".

## Denominative Adjectives

- Adjectives formed from nouns (as opposed to verbal adjectives formed from verbs).
- Formed by adding -*ī*- to the base then adding the endings.

    *maḫr*- + -*ī*- + -*um*/*im*/*am*  == *maḫrûm*, *maḫrîm*, *maḫriam*
- Declined as *annûm*
