## Alephs and Vowel Changes

- There were five Proto-Semitic letters that are not present in Akkadian. These are referred to as aleph 1-5. (Some of these alephs exist in Hebrew.)
    - ʾ<sub>1</sub> = ʾ (א)
    - ʾ<sub>2</sub> = h (ה)
    - ʾ<sub>3</sub> = ḥ (ח)
    - ʾ<sub>4</sub> = ʿ (ע)
    - ʾ<sub>5</sub> = ǵ (ע)
- The Akkadian letters *y* and *w* may also be referred to as alephs.
    - ʾ<sub>6</sub> = w (ו)
    - ʾ<sub>7</sub> = y (י)
- These alephs largely disappear in Akkadian, but they can affect the word formation.
    - If a word began or ended with an ʾ<sub>1-7</sub>, the aleph was lost with no change to the word.

        \*ʾabum > abum (father)

        (exception for *w*, eg wardum)

    - If a word lost an ʾ<sub>1-7</sub> next to a vowel, the vowel lengthend with a macron.

        \*nahrum > nārum (river)

    - If a word lost an ʾ<sub>1-7</sub> between vowels, the two vowels went thru changes based on what they were:
        - *e* or *i* followed by *a* = no change (if first vowel is long, it will become short)
        - *ā* or *ē* followed by *i* = *ê*
        - XY = Ȳ
    - ʾ<sub>3-4</sub> caused *a* to turn to *e*. This can show up when comparing Hebrew and Akkadian.

        \*baʿlum > \*beʿlum > bēlum (בַּ֫עַל)

## Demonstrative Adjectives and Pronouns

### *Annum* (This/these)

This paradigm demonstrates the effect of the aleph and the vowel changes. *annum* in Proto-Semitic was *\*hanniy-*. The *h* is dropped without any affect. However, when the y is dropped and the endings are added, changes occur.

            <td>annîm (*hanniyim)</td>

            <th>Acc S</td>
            <td>anniam (*hanniyam)</td>
            <td>annītam (*hanniytam)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Nom P</td>
            <td>annûtum (*hanniyūtum)</td>
            <td>anniātum (*hanniyātum)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <th>Gen/Acc P</td>
            <td>annûtim (*hanniyūtim)</td>
            <td>anniātim (*hanniyātim)</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

- *annum* is the most common near demonstrative in OB.
- When paired with other adjectives, it comes last (eg. *šamnum ṭābum annum* this fine oil)
- The feminine singular (*annītum*) may be used as a neuter demonstrative pronoun.

### *Su* (That/those)
