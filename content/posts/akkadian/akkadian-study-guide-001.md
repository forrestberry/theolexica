### Notes on the Vowels

- The length of the vowels is an important part of the spelling. (mutum ‘husband’ vs mūtum ‘death’)
- Long vowels are marked either with a macron, *ā*, or with a circumﬂex, *â*, depending on the origin of the length (see [Lesson 6]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-006.md" >}})).

### Notes on the Consonants

- w does not occur before other consonants 
    - except itself
    - except at the end of a word
- y only occurs between vowels or (rarely) at the beginning of a word)
    - also transliterated as 'j'
- ʾ (aleph) only occurs between vowels and rarely at the end of a syllable
    - some scholars put an aleph between every doubled vowel
    - ignored in the dictionary (words containing ʾ are treated as if it were not there)
- all consonants can be doubled
- b, d, g, z are "voiced"
- p, t, k, s are "voiceless"
- q, ṣ, ṭ are "emphatic" (important later, see [Lesson 9]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-009.md" >}}))

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Voiced</th>
            <th>Voiceless</th>
            <th>Emphatic</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>b</td>
        <td>p</td>
        <td>—</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>d</td>
        <td>t</td>
        <td>ṭ</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>g</td>
        <td>k</td>
        <td>q</td>
    </tr>

        <td>s</td>
        <td>ṣ</td>
    </tr>

    - note the coorespondences in the physiology (e.g. b & p are formed the same way in the mouth, one is voiced, one not)

## Syllables

- The writing system is based on syllables. Therefore crucial to master syllabification!
- Three rules:
    1. Every syllable has one and only one vowel.
    1. No syllable may begin with a vowel
        - except the beginning of a word
        - except the second of two vowels (kiam -> ki / am)
    1. No syllable may begin or end with two consonants

## Accents

- Three types of syllables:
    1. light - ends in a short vowel
    1. heavy - ends in a macron-long vowel (ā) *or* short vowel + consonant
    1. ultraheavy - ends in a circumflex-long vowel (â) *or* long vowel + consonant

            <td>â</td>

        <tr>
            <td>—</td>
            <td>am</td>
            <td>ām or âm</td>

            <tr>
                <th>Short</th>
                <th>Heavy</th>
                <th>Ultraheavy</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>short vowel</td>
            <td>macron-long vowel</td>
            <td>circumflex-long vowel</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>—</td>
            <td>short vowel + consonant</td>
            <td>long vowel + consonant</td>

- Stress goes as far forward as as the syllable type allows.
    1. If the last syllable is ultraheavy, it is stressed. 
        - This is the only time the last syllable can be stressed.
    1. Otherwise, the last non-final heavy or ultraheavy syllable is stressed. 
        - This is the only time a middle syllable can be stressed.
    1. Otherwise, the first syllable is stressed.
