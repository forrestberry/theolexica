## 4.1 Vowel Syncope

- Two [light syllables]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-001.md" >}}) cannot stand immediately next to one another.
    - If two stand next to each other, the second is **syncopated** (omitted). eg. \*\*napišātum > napšātum
    - Exceptions can occur:
        - at the end of a word (most often prepositions) eg. ina
        - before a vowel (rabiam)
        - before *r* and *l* (zikarum, ubilū)
        - other exceptions less frequently

## 4.2 Attributive Adjective

- Directly modify a noun (*mighty kings*)
- Follow the modified noun (*šarrū dannūtum*, mighty kings)
- Agree with the noun in gender, number, case
- Can modify more than one noun (compound antecedent)
    - takes a plural adjective (*abum u mārum dannūtum*, the mighty father and son)
    - mixed gender takes a masculine adjective (*abum u ummum dannūtum*, the mighty father and mother)
- Endings are the same as [nouns]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-002.md" >}}).
    - Exceptions:
        - masculine plural endings are -ūtum, -ūtim
        - no dual adjectives; dual nouns take a **feminine plural** adjective

## 4.3 The G Verbal Adjective
