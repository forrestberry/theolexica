## 4.1 Vowel Syncope

- Two [light syllables]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-001.md" >}}) cannot stand immediately next to one another.
    - If two stand next to each other, the second is **syncopated** (omitted). eg. \*\*napišātum > napšātum
    - Exceptions can occur:
        - at the end of a word (most often prepositions) eg. ina
        - before a vowel (rabiam)
        - before *r* and *l* (zikarum, ubilū)
        - other exceptions less frequently

## 4.2 Attributive Adjective

- Directly modify a noun (*mighty kings*)
- Follow the modified noun (*šarrū dannūtum*, mighty kings)
- Agree with the noun in gender, number, case
- Can modify more than one noun (compound antecedent)
    - takes a plural adjective (*abum u mārum dannūtum*, the mighty father and son)
    - mixed gender takes a masculine adjective (*abum u ummum dannūtum*, the mighty father and mother)
- Endings are the same as [nouns]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-002.md" >}}).
    - Exceptions:
        - masculine plural endings are -ūtum, -ūtim
        - no dual adjectives; dual nouns take a **feminine plural** adjective

## 4.3 The G Verbal Adjective

- Many adjectives are formed from the [verbal root]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-003.md" >}}).
    - not all verbal roots have attested verbal adjectives
    - more rarely vice versa
    - meaning is related to the verbal root in a generally passive manner (i.e. "to strike" (*maḫaṣum*) becomes "struck" (*maḫṣum*), not "striking")
- The G verbal adjective pattern is **parVs** (R<sub>1</sub>aR<sub>2</sub>VRr<sub>3</sub>), where *V* is a short vowel.
    - most of the time *V* is *i*; must be memorized when not *i*
    - *V* is only visible in the feminine singular due to Vowel Syncope (above)
    - *V* is not necessarily the same as the theme vowel

## 4.4 Substantizing Adjectives

- Any adjective can be used as a noun.
- In the masculine plural, the noun (-um/im) or adjective (-ūtum/ūtim) endings may be used.
- Feminine singular *may* be used as an abstract noun (eg. *damqum* = "the good man", but *damiqtum* = "goodness")

## 4.5 *ul(a)*

- Negates the predicate of a main clause
- Placed immediately before the verb. (*ḫuraṣam ina bītim um aṣbat*)
- If no verb, placed immediately before predicate. (*ul šarrum ša Bābilim šu*)
