## Assimilation of *n*

- *n* nearly always assimilates to the following consonant
- the following consonant then doubles (called *compensatory lengthening*)
    - *n*C<sub>1</sub> > C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub>
    - The verbal adjective of *šakānum* is *šaknum*. In the feminine singular, it is *\*\*šakintum* > *šakittum*.
- Exceptions:
    - frequently, verbal adjectives with a second radical of *n*
    - Sumerian loan words

## Assimilation before Feminine Marker *t*

- *d* and *ṭ* completely assimilate with the accompanying compensatory lengthening (e.g. *\*\*kašidtum* > *kašittum*)
- sibilants (*s*, *ṣ*, *z*) become *š*
- exceptions are rare

## Weak Verbs

- Weak verbs contain one or more radicals that are prone to phonological change.
- Weak verbs identified with a Roman numeral and the weak consonant
    - e.g. I-*n*, identifies a verb with a first radical of *n*
- The weak radicals are *ʾ*, *y*, *n*, *w*.
    - *n* assimilates anywhere (not just verbs).
    - *ʾ*, *y*, *w* generally only adjust in verbs.
        - The generic designation "-weak", refers to the consonants *ʾ*, *w*, *y*.

### G Preterite I-*n* Verbs

- always assimilate due to *n* always being followed by a consonant
    - Verbal adjective and Infinitive are always regular due to *n* always being followed by a vowel.

## Verb Semantics

- **Double Accusatives**: some Akkadian verbs take two direct objects.
    - Rarely occurs in English (She taught him Akkadian.)
    - More common but still not frequent in Akkadian. Pay attention to the vocabulary entries to identify which verbs take a double accusative.
- **Prepositions**: prepositions can have particular meaning with (certain) verbs.
    - Pay attention to the vocabulary.
    - *ina*, normally instrumental or locative, can have the sense of "from" with verbs (*amtum ina bītim iḫliq* "the slave escaped *from* the house", not "the slave escaped *in/with* the house")
        - *ina qātim ša* not "in the hand of" but "from the hand of"
