## Sound Changes

- *i* > *e*
    - Before the consonants *r* and *h*, *i* could change to *e*. This is inconsistent (cf. *nakirum*, *nakerum*, *nakrum*)
- *a* > *e*
    - *a* and *e* vowels would not exist in the same word. The *a* would become an *e*.

    \**bēlātum* > *bēlētum*
    - Exceptions:
        - There are a number of precise rules, but the gist is that if it is part of an ending or connection to an ending, the *a* is unchanged.

## III-weak G Verbs

- III-weak verbs are verbs that are missing the third radical. (It has dropped out.)
- Basic rules for forming the verb:
    - If the third radical would have occurred after a vowel, nothing happens (end in the vowel).

        cf *iprus* & *ibni*

    - If the third radical would have occured before a consonant, lengthen the vowel.

        cf *damiqtum* & *banītum*

    - If the form would have a vocalic ending, follow the [vowel lengthening rules]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-006.md" >}}).

        cf *iprusū* & *ibnû*

- Note: the masculine, nominative, singular is the same as the infinitive nominative.
- Compare to the [strong verbal adjective]({{< ref "akkadian-study-guide-004.md" >}}).

## Coordinators

- *u*
    - "and" (also "but")
    - independent word
    - used to join nouns, phrases, and clauses
        - combines equally (no stress given to first or second clause)
- -*ma*
    - "and" (also "but")
    - enclitic
    - if attached to a vowel, lengthens the vowel
    - if attached to *n*, the *n* usually assimilates to the *m*
        - rarely also happens with *b* and *p*
    - used to join clauses
        - usually connects clauses with verbs in the same mood
        - logical relationship between the clauses
            - first is logically subordinate to second
- -*ma* *u*
    - "and also"
    - treat as -*ma*
- *ū* and *ū lū*
    - "or"
    - *u* and *ū* indistinguishable in writing system
    - can be combined in various ways for "either...or"
- Asyndeton
    - clauses joined together without a coordinator
