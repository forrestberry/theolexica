- Idea from [Athas, 458-463](https://www.everand.com/read/732669995/Bridging-the-Testaments-The-History-and-Theology-of-God-s-People-in-the-Second-Temple-Period)[^1]
    - Jews and Samaritan's likely mortgaged (consecrated) their homes to the temple in order to get cash as the economy moved to a monetary system. 
    - Concept of consecrating from Torah (ev 27:14-21). 
    - A flat 20% interest was better than the predatory practices of elites and slavery.
    - Temple had money due to tithing system.
    - Criticism: no direct evidence for these temple mortgages at this time.
