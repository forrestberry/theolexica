## Idea

I am researching the role of the temple as a bank in Second Temple Judaism. This has direct bearing on the practice of the laws of dedication and Jesus' reaction to the moneychangers.

- Idea from [Athas, 458-463](https://www.everand.com/read/732669995/Bridging-the-Testaments-The-History-and-Theology-of-God-s-People-in-the-Second-Temple-Period) [^1]
    - Jews and Samaritan's likely mortgaged (consecrated) their homes to the temple in order to get cash as the economy moved to a monetary system. 
    - Concept of consecrating from Torah (Lev 27:14-21). 
    - A flat 20% interest was better than the predatory practices of elites and slavery.
    - Temple had money due to tithing system.
    - Criticism: no direct evidence for these temple mortgages at this time.

## Temple Treasury
- Joshua 6:19
    - But all silver and gold, and every vessel of bronze and iron, are holy to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD." (<span class="hebrew">אוֹצָר</span>)
- [2 Maccabees 3:6](https://bible.oremus.org/?passage=2%20Maccabees%203:6&version=nrsvae)
    - and reported to him that the treasury in Jerusalem was full of untold sums of money, so that the amount of the funds could not be reckoned, and that they did not belong to the account of the sacrifices, but that it was possible for them to fall under the control of the king.
    - [2 Maccabees Notes]({{< ref "2-maccabees.md" >}})
- κορβανας
    - Matt 27:6
        - But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money. (κορβανᾶς)
    - cf Mark 7:11 κορβᾶν
    - Josephus, War of the Jews 2.17.4 [175]
        - "On a later occasion he [Pilate] provoked a fresh uproar by expending upon the construction of an aqueduct the sacred treasure known as Corbonas" (καλεῖται δὲ κορβωνᾶς)

    - Reviews the role of the priesthood and the institution of the Second Temple. Demostrates that the priesthood was not merely a Jerusalem-focused cult but affected all Palestine.

## Biblical Texts
- Leviticus 27:14-21
    - [Notes on Leviticus 27]({{< ref "leviticus-27.md" >}})
    - When a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the LORD, the priest shall value it as either good or bad; as the priest values it, so it shall stand. And if the donor wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth to the valuation price, and it shall be his. "If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land that is his possession, then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed. A homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, the valuation shall stand, but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the price according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from the valuation. And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth to its valuation price, and it shall remain his. But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed anymore. But the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be a holy gift to the LORD, like a field that has been devoted. The priest shall be in possession of it.
- Micah 6:9-15
    - The voice of the LORD cries to the city- and it is sound wisdom to fear your name: "Hear of the rod and of him who appointed it! Can I forget any longer the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is accursed? Shall I acquit the man with wicked scales and with a bag of deceitful weights? Your rich men are full of violence; your inhabitants speak lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth. Therefore I strike you with a grievous blow, making you desolate because of your sins. You shall eat, but not be satisfied, and there shall be hunger within you; you shall put away, but not preserve, and what you preserve I will give to the sword. You shall sow, but not reap; you shall tread olives, but not anoint yourselves with oil; you shall tread grapes, but not drink wine.
    - Chaney, Marvin L. "Micah—Models Matter: Political Economy and Micah 6:9-15"
        - How to understand Economic models in a particular passage. Particularly interesting is the "treasures of the wicked in the house of the wicked" as a parrallel or euphemism for the treasures of the temple.
- [Jesus and the Money Changers]({{< ref "jesus-money-changers.md" >}})
    - Matt 21:12-13
        - And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. He said to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers."
    - Mark 11:15-17
        - And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. And he was teaching them and saying to them, "Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers."
    - Luke 19:45-46
        - And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold, saying to them, "It is written, 'My house shall be a house of prayer,' but you have made it a den of robbers."
    - John 2:13-16
        - The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there. And making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, "Take these things away; do not make my Father's house a house of trade."

    - short description of when the money changers would set up tables and who they would tax and how much.
