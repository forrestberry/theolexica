## Leviticus 27:14-21

- [See note on Temple Mortgages]({{< ref "temple-mortgages.md" >}})
- Philo treats 20% fee as punishment for foolish behavior [^1]

> he shall pay its price and a fifth besides, punishing his own rashness and impetuous desire for his two faults, his rashness for making the vow, and his impetuous desire for wishing for things back again which he had before abandoned.

## Resources

- Jacob Milgrom, <i>Leviticus: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary. 23 - 27</i>, First Yale University Press impression, The Anchor Bible 3B (New Haven London: Yale University Press, 2010)o.
- Morales, L. Michael. <i>Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord? A Biblical Theology of the Book of Leviticus.</i> New Studies in Biblical Theology 37. Downers Grove, IL: Apollos: InterVarsity Press, 2015.
    - Chapter 7 focuses on the earthly temple and its role in Israel's history, including the exile and restoration. This resource is heavy on theology and lighter on history but provides some valuable thought on how Israel understood and approached the temple.
    - Chapter 8 focuses on the transition to the eternal temple and the person of Jesus. Some valuable insight on Jesus' and the NT approach to the temple here.
- Beale, G. K. <i>The Temple and the Church’s Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God.</i> New Studies in Biblical Theology 17. Downers Grove, IL: Apollos: Inter-Varsity Press, 2004.
    - Chapter 3-4 contain some suprisingly relevant content on the temple's use in the OT. Starting with symbolism in chapter 2 it moves on to the expanded ways that the temple was used (eg treasury) in chapter 3.
    - Chapter 11 discusses the temple in Ezekiel with both a near term view on attitudes toward the temple as well as the wrapped up eschatological view.
