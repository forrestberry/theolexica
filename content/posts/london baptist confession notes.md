## Intro

The church we are attending in Estonia, [Grace Bible Church](https://www.gracebiblechurch.ee), uses the [Second London Baptist Confession](https://the1689.org) as their statement of faith. 

I really appreciate a church using a historic confession. It keeps you grounded in the historic faith and connects you to a line of believers. In general, I think it is a bad idea for a church to draft their own statement of faith. It tends to be idiosyncratic and too narrow (both in failing to address things that it should and addressing things that it shouldn't).

However, I have never attended a church does this. I have read the London Baptist Confession in the past, but never so carefully. Reading it with an eye to joining a church changes your perspective.

Cards on the table, I am a [Master's Seminary](https://tms.edu) grad and would generally agree with their statement of faith. This means that I am reforedish: Calvinistic soteriology, progressive dispensationalist, with a high view of the Scriptures.

## Notes on the Second London Baptist Confession

I'm not trying to be exxhaustive here. This are areas where I had thoughts reading through it or have a disagreement/diffulty with the text.

### Preface

Says very little with a lot of words.

One thought here in our context, we are in an international church. Many of the people in our church speak English as a second language. The LBC is tough to read for a lot of native speakers.
