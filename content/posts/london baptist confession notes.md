## Intro

The church we are attending in Estonia, [Grace Bible Church](https://www.gracebiblechurch.ee), uses the [Second London Baptist Confession](https://the1689.org) as their statement of faith. 

I really appreciate a church using a historic confession. It keeps you grounded in the historic faith and connects you to a line of believers. In general, I think it is a bad idea for a church to draft their own statement of faith. It tends to be idiosyncratic and too narrow (both in failing to address things that it should and addressing things that it shouldn't).

However, I have never attended a church does this. I have read the London Baptist Confession in the past, but never so carefully. Reading it with an eye to joining a church changes your perspective.

Cards on the table, I am a [Master's Seminary](https://tms.edu) grad and would generally agree with their statement of faith. This means that I am reforedish: Calvinistic soteriology, progressive dispensationalist, with a high view of the Scriptures.

## Notes on the Second London Baptist Confession

I'm not trying to be exxhaustive here. This are areas where I had thoughts reading through it or have a disagreement/diffulty with the text.

One thing that surprised me reading through this is the thoroughness of the confession. The confession could easily be used as a teaching outline (which is at least part of its purpose.)

The other surprising element was how modern it felt. The LBC addresses many issues that are current today. From the continuation of gifts to marriage issues, a lot of the modern issues can be taught out of the LBC.

### Preface

Says very little with a lot of words.

One thought here in our context, we are in an international church. Many of the people in our church speak English as a second language. The LBC is tough to read for a lot of native speakers.

### Of the Holy Scriptures

#### Chapter 1

I appreciate the logic that is presented about revelation in point one. Natural revelation is there pointing us to God, but it is insufficient for a true knowledge of God and salvation.

Therefore, God has revealed himself out of his own good will in various ways for the good of his people. But due to the corruption, he has commited the message to writing.

Therefore, the Holy Scriptures are most necessary because the former ways of revelation have ceased.

The LBC assumes a basically cessationist position. There's probably room here for an open but cautious perspective, but the emphasis is clearly on the Scriptures as the Word of God. The place we should be looking for the will of God, the place for all comfort and knowledge, encouragement and training is the Scriptures.

#### Chapter 3

Mildly interesting that the Apochrypha is considered to be no more helpful than any other human writing. In other places you will see a recommendation to read the apochrypha as historically significant or as spiritually uplifting texts. Similar to how we might uphold the puritans as a generally helpful category of writings.

In the Protestant world, the Apochrypha has been treated with suspicion at best. Most Protestants, even widely read ones, have not read the Apochrypha.

#### Chapter 4 - 5

Very Van Tillian.

#### Chapter 6

The role of the Holy Spirit and the mind of believers have a specific relation to the Word. The Holy Spirit is not providing new revelation but opening up the minds and hearts of humans to the written Word. 

The sanctified mind has freedom within the boundaries of the rules of the Word to make wise decisions for the running of church, government, and other affairs.

This is a carefule application of the Word. It is sufficient and there, but it is not alone. The Holy Spirit must open our eyes and give us a new heart to understand it. As believers, we must use our reason and the principles of the Word to make righteous decisions.

#### Chapter 8

The Scriptures should be translated. Ultimately, it is the Scriptures in the original languages that are inspired, but the word ought to be translated into every common tongue to which the gospel goes in order that the people may possess the benefits of the word.

The implication for missions is clear. The Scriptures should be translated as the Gospel spreads.

#### Chapter 10

Our confidence in theology rests not in any preacher or council or tradition, but in the Holy Scriptures alone.
