## What's Anki?

[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is a flashcard tool. 

It's built on the principle of `spaced repetion`, meaning that it repeats the cards based on your ability to answer.

There's lofs of info out there on how exactly it works. It really is a cheat code for anything you need to memorize.

I use it for everything from my kids' birthdays to language learning.

## Anki Tips

- Cloze deletion cards are almost always the best option.
- Writing your own cards is always best, but steal when necessary.
- When memorizing vocab, take the time to do a first pass outside of anki. I prefer to write things out by hand until I "know" it, then start anki after a quick break.
- For charts, have an LLM build you an html version and use that with cloze deletions.
- Multiple ways of asking the same question is good.
- For language learning, throw some exercises from the book in there as well.
