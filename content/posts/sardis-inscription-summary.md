The material is conveniently presented in five groups, the inscrip- tions of
each group being arranged chronologically: Documents and Public Eecords, the
most important group (1-20) ; Honorific Texts (21-84) ; Votive Texts and
Dedications (85-lOlh) ; Sepul- chral Inscriptions, by far the largest of all
(102-176); and Mis- cellaneous Texts and Fragments (177-228). While no
inscription of outstanding historical importance has been found, there are
many, especially in Group 1, which are of value and interest. Thus No. 1, pp.
1-7, Pis. I-II, from a stone found inside the temple in 1910 and dating from c.
200 B. C., is republished from AJA XYI, 1912, 11-82. **It describes a temple
mortgage securing a loan on lands to a certain Mnesimachos and has interesting
legal features.** No. 8, the longest inscription in the book, pp. 16-27, PI.
IV, also republished from the same Journal, XVIII, 1914, 322-62, contains
twelve doctiments concerning a certain Menogenes of Sardis which date from 5-1
B. C. — three letters, one from Augustus to the Sardians, and nine decrees of
the commonalty of Asia or the Council of Sardis, an interesting record in the
his- tory of the Eoman province of Asia.
