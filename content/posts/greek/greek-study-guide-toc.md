## What

These are my guides for anything Greek related. I'll throw resources in here and try to keep it somewhat organized as I go. As always, use the `Greek` tag to find all the posts. 

### Grammars

I occasionally work through different Greek grammars. I used [Black's](https://newtestamentgreekportal.blogspot.com/p/dave-blacks-greek-tools.html) in seminary. I taught through [Mounce's](https://www.billmounce.com/basicsofbiblicalgreek/grammar) at one point.


### Schwandt's Grammar Notes

It's been a while and my greek is getting rusty, so I am working through [Schwandt's **An Introduction To Biblical Greek A Grammar**](https://lexhampress.com/Schwandt). I picked this one because I already had it in Logos, and I appreciate most things by Lexham Press.
