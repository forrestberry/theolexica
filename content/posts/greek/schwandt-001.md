## The Alphabet

### What I Don't Like about This Chapter

This is a great example of an introductory grammar doing too much. There's a lot of interesting detail in here. But most of it is irrelevant for getting going with learning Greek.

#### History

I love the history of the alphabet. I have written a couple of papers on it, and regularly read new papers that come my way on academia.com. But it doesn't matter at all to learning Greek. Leave those interesting details to the teacher.

#### Uncials & Miniscules

You can ignore the notes on uncials and miniscules until you are start looking at NT textual criticism. Then dive deep.

#### Transliteration

Transliteration doesn't really matter today. You'll still see it in older books, but it's pretty intuitive to read. Today, it's easy to get a greek font/keyboard on your computer and type out Greek letters. You'll never need to transliterate.

#### Pronunciation systems

I would argue that it doesn't really matter. Go with whatever your teacher goes with. If you are self-taught, I would say Erasmian is probably more popular, but Koine or Erasmian is fine. I would avoid the Modern Greek.

#### Digraphs and Diphthongs

I think the break down here and in the exercises is too pedantic. I'll just call them diphthongs. 

#### Classification of Consonants

Again, too much detail. Some of this information is useful for understanding word and form changes later on. I would introduce it later when it becomes relevant. But most of this isn't really relevant then.

Would be great if the book had a head diagram to show where the sounds are made.

## Learn What Matters

If you are a first time student, the three things that matter:
- mastering the lowercase letters
- getting a handle on how to pronounce all the letters and their combinations
- basic grasp of the upper case letters

## Exercises

### Note

The exercises are the most important part of any lesson. Your pattern should be to understand the lesson and then work through the exercises, memorizing the key information as you go. 

A well done practice set will help you memorize and prevent you from moving forward without memorizing.

### Schwandt's Exercises

- Write out the lowercase alphabet by hand until you have it memorized.
- Skip the rest of Schwandt's exercises. I think he's asking you to memorize and internalize things that will come naturally after being exposed to the language over time.

### Recommended Exercises

- Read out the alphabet from the chart above. Make sure you know how to say the name of every characer.
- Name each character

<greek-name-alphabet></greek-name-alphabet>

and the reverse

<greek-name-alphabet reverse></greek-name-alphabet>



- Write out the alphabet by hand until you can do it from memory in under 30 seconds.
- 

- Learn to recognize the capital letters.

<greek-capitals-recognition></greek-capitals-recognition>

- Learn to [type the Greek alphabet]({{< ref "type-greek.md" >}}). I know it's a big ask, but I think it's workth it for two reasons:
    1. I'll include a bunhc of excerisizes here that will require you to be able to type. 
    2. I think it will make your academic career a lot easier being able to type Greek. It's one of those little skills that gives you a leg up in all kinds of ways from looking up words to writing papers.
