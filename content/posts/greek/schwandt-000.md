## Preface

- I appreciate the focus on learning to read and write.
- Seeems to have a rigorous approach to learning the language at a deeper level.

In general, this is a good thing. Language learning has been reduced to a lowest common denominator. The focus is not on learning the language in order to read, but learning the language enough to read a technical commentary.

Pastors should have a deep understanding of their field. They should know their bibles, from the languages through to NT and OT issues, and up to theology and applied studies. The fundamentals of the languages are really important.

- I'll be interested to see where he goes with the focus on the spelling. 

Somewhat paradoxically, I think that most grammars over-complicate learning the languages. Most aspects of grammar are really simple to understand. We all know how to speak and read. What is difficult is the practice of the new language - getting it into your bones. This comes through active recall and practice.

When learning a languge, keep it simple and practice -- a lot.

- Apparently there is a companion Logos mobile course with video instruction. I am not going through that.
