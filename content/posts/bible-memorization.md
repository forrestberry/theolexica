Memorizing the Bible is a key spiritual discipline. "Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not sin against Thee," is a passage that I have memorized from childhood.

Memorizing and meditating on the word of God is commended in the Bible and important for our well being.

## Tips:

- Set aside a fixed time and place to memorize.
- When reciting, your aim is to be able to say the verse as smoothly and as accurately as if you were reading it off of a page to a group of people. If you have to hem and haw or pause for a long time and think, then it's not solid enough in your brain. Keep reciting and practicing.
- For reviewing, take 30-60 seconds here and there without diverting from regular life, and insert recitation into the short passive moments, like in the bathroom, driving, etc.
- Put a screenshot of the verse on your phone lock screen.
- Try the [Bible Memory App](https://biblememory.com)
- Journal on the passage you are memorizing.

### My personal process:

- Initial memorization with [verse memorizor tool]({{< ref "verse-memorizer.md" >}}) I made.
- Add to anki
- Review in anki.

### Family process:

When we memorize with kids, it is all oral since half our kids can't read yet.
- Break into a manageable chunk, usually 10-15 words.
- Say the chunk aloud with words displayed (usually on a tv) five times.
- Say the chunk without words five times.
- Give each person a chance to say it until we can all say it without error.
- Repeat the process and review at breakfast and bedtime.
