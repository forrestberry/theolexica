- Use a linguistics chart of the head to explain where all the sounds are located.
    - Give students a tactile and visual feel for where sounds are
    - Becomes important later for sound changes
- Give some history of the alphabet and trace how it came down to English
    - trace some letters out acrophonically (eg aleph > alpum)
    - point isn't really to teach ancient abjab, but to interest students, and show what is there
    - also may give some hooks for memory, but won't have time to do all letters
- Discuss the concept of a word family, like a fact family in math.
    - We have this in English, but nowhere near to the degree in Semitic languages.
