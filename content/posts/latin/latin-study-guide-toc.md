## What

These are all of my study guides for my Latin studies. I've used a number of sources: 

- *Wheelock's Latin*
- *Learn to Read Latin*
- *Lingua Latina*

## Goals

Throw together my own personal notes, charts, and [anki decks]({{< ref "../anki.md" >}}).

## Non Goals

- Create a systematic set of notes.
- Map to a particular grammar.
- No attempt at comprehensiveness.

Use the `Latin` tag to find all related notes.
