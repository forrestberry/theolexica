This is a quick tool for helping you memorize Bible Verses or really any text.

I use this as part of the process for memorizing verses, catechism, poems, or any text I want to remember before I put them in Anki. Anki is great for memorizing things that you already have a handle on. You don't want to use it to learn a verse from scratch. This tool helps to gradually learn the text by removing parts until you can type the whole thing. It's a quick and dirty solution, but gets the job done.
