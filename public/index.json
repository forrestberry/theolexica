In Akkadian, the similar form (qatalku) is not perfective. It is predicative (see Lesson 22).

(View all study guides.) 2.1 Nouns Noun Endings singular dual plural nominative —um —ān —ū genitive —im —īn —ī accusative —am —īn —ī Note: The genitive and accusative are identical in the dual and plural.\nCase There are three cases: nominative, genitive, accusative Gender There are two genders: masculine and feminine. Feminine is generally marked out by an t infix. For phonological reasons, the t can be preceeded by an a when the base ends in two consonants. (See syllable rules in chapter 1.) e.g. iltum, šarratum Exceptions: Some nouns that look masculine are feminine and vice versa. Some nouns that are masculine in the singular are feminine in the plural (and vice versa). Some nouns are variable gender. Masculine is the common plural. Exceptions need to be memorized. Number There are three numbers: singular, dual, plural. Singular End in m (mimation) Dual The dual indicates precisely two and is usully confined to natural pairs (eg, eyes) Genitive and accusative have the same form end in n (nunation) Adjectives, verbs, and pronouns do not have dual forms (in OB). dual nouns have plural agreement. Plural Genitive and accusative have the same form. In the masculine, the ending is a macron-long version of the singular vowel ending. (um -\u0026gt; ū, im -\u0026gt; ī) In the feminine, the t infix is always accompanied with a ā (-āt-) In the feminine, end in m (mimation) Some words occur only in plural. \u0026ldquo;Collectives\u0026rdquo; are collective nouns that describe groups and can be construed in singular or plural (e.g. ṣābum: singular= worker, solder; collective= gang, troop) 2.2 Prepositions Most prepositions are two-syllable words ending in a short vowel. Nouns following prepositions are always in the genitive. 2.3 ša ša means \u0026ldquo;the one of\u0026rdquo; usually occurs in apposition to a preceeding noun the following noun appears in the genitive eg šarrum ša Bābilim (king of Babylon) 2.4 Independent Personal Pronouns Singular Plural 1c anāku ‘I’ nīnu ‘we’ 2m atta ‘you (ms)’ attunu ‘you (mp)’ 2f atti ‘you (fs)’ attina ‘you (fp)’ 3m šū ‘he, it (m)’ šunu ‘they (m)’ 3f ši ‘she, it (f)’ šina ‘they (f)’ Used in subjects of verbless clauses (see more uses in Chapter 3) 2.5 Verbless Clauses No being verb in Akkadian. Copulative sentences are formed by juxtaposing the subject and predicate. Called verbless or nominative clauses If subject is a noun, it stands at beginning of the clause. If subjecf is a pronoun, it stands at the end of the clause. Tense is determined by context. amātum ina ālim \u0026ldquo;The maidservants are/were/will be in the town.\u0026rdquo;\nAdverb (phrase) - Noun (phrase) occurs less frequently. ina libbim ša ālim nārum \u0026ldquo;In the center of the town (there) is a river.\u0026rdquo;\nWith ša and a following genitive, verbless clauses represent simple possession. bītum ša iltim \u0026ldquo;The house is the goddess\u0026rsquo;s.\u0026rdquo;\nTODO: Anki deck\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/akkadian/akkadian-study-guide-002/","summary":"A study guide for A Grammar of Akkadian Third Edition by John Huehnergard.

(mutum ‘husband’ vs mūtum ‘death’) Long vowels are marked either with a macron, ā, or with a circumﬂex, â depending on the origin of the length (see Lesson 6). Consonants w does not occur before other consonants except itself except at the end of a word y only occurs between vowels or (rarely) at the beginning of a word) also transliterated as \u0026lsquo;j\u0026rsquo; ʾ (aleph) only occurs between vowels and rarely at the end of a syllable some scholars put an aleph between every doubled vowel ignored in the dictionary (words containing ʾ are treated as if it were not there) all consonants can be doubled b, d, g, z are \u0026ldquo;voiced\u0026rdquo; p, t, k, s are \u0026ldquo;voiceless\u0026rdquo; q, ṣ, ṭ are \u0026ldquo;emphatic\u0026rdquo; (important later, see Lesson 9) Voiced Voiceless Emphatic b p — d t ṭ g k q z s ṣ - note the coorespondences in the physiology (e.g. b \u0026 p are formed the same way in the mouth, one is voiced, one not) 1.2 Syllables The writing system is based on syllables. Therefore crucial to master syllabification! Three rules: Every syllable has one and only one vowel. No syllable may begin with a vowel except the beginning of a word except the second of two vowels (kiam -\u0026gt; ki / am) No syllable may begin or end with two consonants 1.3 Accents Three types of syllables:\nlight - ends in a short vowel heavy - ends in a macron-long vowel (ā) or short vowel + consonant ultraheavy - ends in a circumflex-long vowel (â) or long vowel + consonant Short Heavy Ultraheavy a ā â — am ām or âm Short Heavy Ultraheavy short vowel macron-long vowel circumflex-long vowel — short vowel + consonant long vowel + consonant Stress goes as far forward as as the syllable type allows.\nIf the last syllable is ultraheavy, it is stressed. This is the only time the last syllable can be stressed. Otherwise, the last non-final heavy or ultraheavy syllable is stressed. This is the only time a middle syllable can be stressed. Otherwise, the first syllable is stressed.
