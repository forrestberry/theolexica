A study guide for *A Grammar Of Akkadian* Third Edition by John Huehnergard.

### Goal

Outline the bare-bones of the grammar in an easily digestible and memorizable format.

Include an Anki flashcard deck for each section.

Non-goal: to be a cliff-notes or drop in replacement for the grammar. (Much of this cheatsheet will be incomprehensible without reading the grammar.)

## Introduction

- Akkadian is 
    - the oldest Semitic language.
    - the lingua franca of the ANE from about 2000-500 BC
    - aka Assyrian and Babylonian
- Material culture
    - written on clay tablets (good because virtually indestructible)
        - vary in size from 1in square to 18in square
        - most are hand-sized rectangles
        - written on the face, but also the edges (often so could be read on a shelf)
    - written with wedge-shaped stylus
    - hundreds of thousands of extant texts (more than classical Latin)
- Cuneiform
    - "wedge shaped"
    - writing system of Akkadian
    - syllable based
    - adapted from Sumerian (a non-related by geographically close language)
    - each character called a "sign"
    - thousands of signs
        - varies based on time and geography
        - transliteration involves use of *sign list*

### Dialects
- **Assyrian** (in the north)
- **Babylonian** (in the south)
- **Old Babylonian** becomes the classical standard
- **Standard Babylonian** is the later imitation of Old Babylonian
- **Peripheral Akkadian** is the term for the Akkadian dialects of futher reaches (often mixed with the grammar and vocabulary of the native language.)

#### Vowels

- The length of the vowels is an important part of the spelling. (mutum ‘husband’ vs mūtum ‘death’)
- Long vowels are marked either with a macron, ā, or with a circumﬂex, â depending on the origin of the length (see Lesson 6).

    <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Short Vowel</th>
          <th>Value</th>
          <th>Long Vowel</th>
          <th>Value</th>
        </tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>e</td>
            <td>e as in pet</td>
            <td>ē, ê</td>
            <td>e as in reign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>i</td>
            <td>i as in pit</td>
            <td>ī, î</td>
            <td>i as in marine</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>u</td>
            <td>u as in put</td>
            <td>ū, û</td>
            <td>u as in rule</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

#### Consonants

- w does not occur before other consonants 
    - except itself
    - except at the end of a word
- y only occurs between vowels or (rarely) at the beginning of a word)
    - also transliterated j
- q, ṣ, ṭ are "emphatic" (important later, see Lesson 9)
- ʾ (aleph) only occurs between vowels and rarely at the end of a syllable
    - some scholars put an aleph between every doubled vowel
    - ignored in the dictionary (words containing ʾ are treated as if it were not there)
- all consonants can be doubled

### Syllables

- The writing system is based on syllables. Therefore crucial to master syllabification!
- Three rules:
    1. Every syllable has one and only one vowel.
    1. No syllable may begin with a vowel
        - except the beginning of a word
        - except when syllables doubled
    1. No syllable may begin or end with two consonants

### Accents

- Three types of syllables:
    1. light - ends in a short vowel
    1. heavy - ends in a macron-long vowel (ā) or short vowel + consonant
    1. ultraheavy - ends in a circumflex-long vowel (â) or long vowel + consonant
- Stress can be determined based on:
    1. If the last syllable is ultraheavy, it is stressed.
    1. Otherwise, the last heavy or ultraheavy syllable is stressed.
    1. Otherwise, the first syllable is stressed.
