(mutum ‘husband’ vs mūtum ‘death’) Long vowels are marked either with a macron, ā, or with a circumﬂex, â depending on the origin of the length (see Lesson 6). Consonants w does not occur before other consonants except itself except at the end of a word y only occurs between vowels or (rarely) at the beginning of a word) also transliterated as ‘j’ ʾ (aleph) only occurs between vowels and rarely at the end of a syllable some scholars put an aleph between every doubled vowel ignored in the dictionary (words containing ʾ are treated as if it were not there) all consonants can be doubled b, d, g, z are “voiced” p, t, k, s are “voiceless” q, ṣ, ṭ are “emphatic” (important later, see Lesson 9) Voiced Voiceless Emphatic b p — d t ṭ g k q z s ṣ - note the coorespondences in the physiology (e.g. b \u0026 p are formed the same way in the mouth, one is voiced, one not) 1.2 Syllables The writing system is based on syllables. Therefore crucial to master syllabification! Three rules: Every syllable has one and only one vowel. No syllable may begin with a vowel except the beginning of a word except the second of two vowels (kiam -\u003e ki / am) No syllable may begin or end with two consonants 1.3 Accents Three types of syllables:\nlight - ends in a short vowel heavy - ends in a macron-long vowel (ā) or short vowel + consonant ultraheavy - ends in a circumflex-long vowel (â) or long vowel + consonant Short Heavy Ultraheavy a ā â — am ām or âm Short Heavy Ultraheavy short vowel macron-long vowel circumflex-long vowel — short vowel + consonant long vowel + consonant Stress goes as far forward as as the syllable type allows.\nIf the last syllable is ultraheavy, it is stressed. This is the only time the last syllable can be stressed. Otherwise, the last non-final heavy or ultraheavy syllable is stressed. This is the only time a middle syllable can be stressed. Otherwise, the first syllable is stressed. TODO: Link to Anki vocabulary and anki study guide\n",
